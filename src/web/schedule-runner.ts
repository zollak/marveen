// context accepts the injected keystrokes and never starts a turn, so its pane

//   1. BUSY EXCLUSION: a busy pane is never stuck -- the prompt is running,

// (observed 2026-08-14 on a two-hourly mailbox heartbeat: 277 consecutive
// 'busy' retries over 69 minutes, cleared by hand with C-c/C-u and delivered on

// in the runner ever looked. The message-router already runs exactly this janitor
// on its own queue (JANITOR_PARKED_MIN_AGE_MS, 45s); the schedule queue gets
// the same treatment on a longer fuse, because a deferred heartbeat is less
// urgent than a stranded message and an ordinary long turn must never be
// mistaken for a wedge.
//
// The safety lives in clearStaleParkedInput itself: it acts only on the idle
// 'typing' state, only when the dim-stripped text is unchanged across a settle,
// never on the main agent's box, and at most once per cooldown window per
