"""Shared email-payload extraction (EMAILKAPU901 PR1).

Single source of truth for recovering the OUTGOING LETTER (recipients, subject,
body) from a send invocation, used by BOTH gates:
  - scripts/hooks/outgoing-copy-gate.py (copy audit: accents, names, em dash)
  - the level-2 email approval gate (PR2): content-hash anchor over
    to + cc + subject + body -- the approval record pins the EXACT letter, and
    a send is allowed only on an exact match.

The extraction boundary (Marveen, msg 17900) is deterministic-or-deny:
  - readable literal (--body "...", < /abs/path, heredoc, MCP fields) -> text
  - anything shell-expanded at run time ($(cat), `...`, $VAR, unresolvable
    path, pipe) -> unreadable_reason, and the CALLER must fail closed.
The SAME boundary applies to recipients (msg 17936): a --to that comes from a
variable is not "approximately right", it is unreadable -> deny. A body+subject
hash alone would let an approved letter be re-sent to a DIFFERENT recipient.

collect_bash_body / collect_mcp_body moved here VERBATIM from
outgoing-copy-gate.py (behavior-neutral; parity proven byte-for-byte against a
golden captured from the pre-move code -- scripts/__tests__/email-extract-parity.test.py).
